Scarecrow Florist Website
##Product Description

Scarecrow is an urban farmers market and gourmet kitchen in Auckland Central.
One of its core offerings is flowers. Scarecrow flowers should be the easiest, most compelling and ethical way to buy
flowers for urban Aucklanders.

This function operates relatively
independently from the rest of the business, with a dedicated florist and work
station. It adds beauty, nature and aroma to the store, but to continue, must be financially sustainable in the long-term. Currently, many flower orders come
through an online florist platform. The problem with this is that the platform
is generic, de-localised and not tailored to our customers' needs. One of
Scarecrow's core values is its intention to unite the inner city community, and
provide an authentic, human experience for our customers.

*Scarecrow flowers* has the potential to capture a large audience of inner-city
residents, office workers and students. Competition in the market is relatively
high but not prohibitive, which requires us to differentiate ourselves from the
other businesses selling flowers in the area. Having an online platform which
caters specifically to the Inner-city audience is key to achieving this.

#Product Objectives
##Communicating value
* Scarecrow flowers website needs to communicate our values, as well as the value of the product, clearly and concisely.
* These include; ethical sourcing and growing of produce,
a focus on local, small-scale and artisan producers, an urban and trendy
personality, and a human experience.

##Customer satisfaction
* Customers of Scarecrow flowers have to get what they want. The website needs
to deliver a range of options which match customer needs, and the product
delivered needs to match their expectations.
* The product isn't limited to the flowers, but the whole experience of flower
purchase, from *conception* ("Ah, I'd like to buy something nice for my partner
today" or "I need some flowers for my office foyer"), through *interaction*
("What's a nice gift for my partner that I can order online?" and "How do I
choose the best option?"), to *delivery* ("How quickly and cheaply can it get to
me?" and "Does the product match or exceed my expectations?").
* The payment process needs to be simple to understand, and seamless.

###Delivering Service
* This should meet customer needs, differentiated from other businesses, which,
while we have some understanding of it now, will need to research further
* Current assumptions include:
1/ Customers want to know where their flowers come
from, including the location and grower story
2/ Customers want a fast, seamless, easy experience
3/ Customers want a human experience, which includes being treated like a human,
and connecting with the human on the other end
4/ Customers want a 'no bullshit' approach, which filters out hyperbole,
inauthenticity, and irrationality.
5/ Customers want the product to meet or exceed expectations of quality and
longevity.

##Florist flexibility
* The content and execution of the website needs to minimise the amount of hours
that the florist needs to dedicate to content on the website on a weekly basis
* This includes displaying flexibility or vagueness about product offering, to
enable the florist to include seasonal and available flowers in their
arrangements

##Sustainability
* Get return customers
* Increase customer base
* Increase store visits for customers to indulge in our other product offering
* Improve Scarecrow's reputation
